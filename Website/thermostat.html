<h1> Thermostat </h1>
<br>    
<p> A Smart Thermostat is an alternative to your traditional heating thermostats. They share all the same base functions, however Smart Thermostats come with a few qualities of life upgrades. A smart thermostat has features such as the ability to control your heating wherever and whenever using an app, settings up a schedule for it to follow, as well as the ability to update and learn based on your using patterns and automatically adjust based on you. These are some very nice features, however with all the good you must know switching to a smart device comes with some security risks.
</p>
<br>
<h2> Physical Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<h4> Physical</h4>
<p1> Physically, Smart thermostats aren't really different to traditional thermostats. They serve a similar purpose and find themselves in similar places. The device is on the smaller size though and due to this it could be a target for theft. it's common sense but devices such as these should be kept tucked away or in a safer place due to their value they could be a target.

<h2> Technical Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<p2>
<h4> Data </h4>
Your data is a valuable, a smart thermometer may not seem like the biggest hoarder of data compared to a mobile phone for example. However, there is plenty of data that these devices store which could be targeted, A lot of the newest smart thermometers have a feature that allows them to learn your patterns to then set your times and adjust them automatically. They are almost tracking where and when you need to use your heating. This is great for convenience, you don't need to do any adjusting etc. but this itself is data you do not want being leaked. A device like this could potentially be used to determine when a household is home or not opening them up for theft etc. Now this is just a scenario that most likely won't happen to you, however it is smart to be aware of your data and try to keep it safe.  
<br>
<br>
<h4> Hacking </h4>
A smart thermostat may not be the biggest target for hackers, but that doesn't mean it isn't possible. no matter the smart device's in your home, they all come with the risk of being hacked. The best thing to do is keep your device up to date, make sure it has the most recent security and newest features. Hacking is something you can only go so far to prevent, and the security involved in stopping it should be implemented by the manufacturer's. This guide will not go over every attack that could occur however there are many external tests that have been conducted and published on these devices. If you would like to read more, visit the "published tests" section below.

<br>
<h4> Wi-Fi </h4>
When it comes to Smart Devices, Wi-Fi is one of the most important aspects. it is also one that needs to have a close eye kept on. The security of Wi-Fi is universal for all smart devices. It is the thing that connects these devices and enables them to work. With that comes some security risks to keep track off. Due to smart devices relying on your Wi-Fi you must make sure the Wi-Fi itself is secure. If you are connecting to your home network, making sure your Wi-Fi is private and secure will help prevent most small problems. You should also be careful who you give access to your Wi-Fi network, Once access is gained your devices are at risk, therefore ask questions before handing out your internet passwords to just anyone.
