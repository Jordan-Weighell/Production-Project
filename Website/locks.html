<h1> Smart Locks </h1>
<br>    
<p> Smart Locks are a relatively newer technology, with this comes a less tried and tested method of keeping your premises secure. A Smart Lock is a newer alternative to your traditional lock and key, they are usually paired with a mobile app or remote access which acts as a key. The uses of these locks can vary, but they may include things such as Voice Activation, Remote Access, Alarms, Commands and Auto locking. The features of your Smart Lock may vary depending on the variant you have purchased, however they all have the same purpose of keeping a place secure. Now, all these features are very different to your normal lock and with this comes some extra security risks which we will outline below.
    
</p>
<br>
<h2> Physical Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<h4> Physical </h4>
<p1> Smart Locks themselves are designed as physical security. Most smart locks are designed to be sturdy and physically can be more protective than standard locks. The majority of Smart locks have features such as auto locking, This means that if damaged the Smart lock will automatically lock the door and keep it that way no matter the damage done to it, you can't simply break off a smart lock to gain access.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Pins </h4>
Smart locks can vary in how they are used, some may have a PIN interface as seen in the figure below. It is technically possible to brute force one of these locks by trying combinations, however it is highly unlikely as long as the person who set the PIN chose a secure number.  
</p1>
<br>
<br>    
<h2> Technical Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<h4> Passwords </h4>
<p2> Passwords have already been touched upon above however with a Smart lock a password/Pin Will be usually be necessary, as simple as it sounds a strong password or PIN is an important first step to keeping your Smart lock secure. Avoiding simple passwords or obvious PINS such as "1234" is a vital step in keeping any Smart Devices secure.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Wi-Fi </h4>
When it comes to Smart Devices, Wi-Fi is one of the most important aspects. It is also one that needs to have a close eye kept on. The security of Wi-Fi is universal for all smart devices. It is the thing that connects these devices and enables them to work. With that comes some security risks to keep track off. Due to smart devices relying on your Wi-Fi, you must make sure the Wi-Fi itself is secure. If you are connecting to your home network, making sure your Wi-Fi is private and secure will help prevent most small problems. You should also be careful who you give access to your Wi-Fi network, Once access is gained your devices are at risk, therefore ask questions before handing out your internet passwords to just anyone.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Bluetooth  </h4>
There are a number of Smart Locks that use Bluetooth. What this means is that the owner can have their Phone or other Device linked to their Smart Lock using Bluetooth and without even having to press a button the Lock will unlatch as the user approaches. This is a very useful and seemingly convenient way of using your Smart Lock, however there are some risks involved. If someone managed to acquire your Smartphone, which may be already connected to your Lock, they'd have free and easy access. Using this feature of a Smart Lock requires you to be extra careful of your possessions and make sure nothing is connected to the Bluetooth unnecessarily. 

Bluetooth itself also has its own security risks
<br>
<br>
Smart Locks in particular are very vulnerable to hacking. Due to the nature of a smart lock, it guards your home or wherever it may be. If one of these devices is hacked, that compromises the entire location it is guarding. This is the major reason hacking can be so dangerous to these kinds of devices. It is wise to invest in the strongest lock possible, as some may be more vulnerable than others. 
This guide will not go over every attack that could occur, however there are many external tests that have been conducted and published on these devices. If you would like to read more, visit the "published tests" section below.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Voice Activation </h4>
Voice activation is a useful function of most Smart Locks, it is usually used via a Mobile phone and offers another layer of security. Similar to facial recognition of fingerprints, voice recognition can be used as a way to unlock your device, Even though highly unlikely someone could theoretically take a voice recording and use that in place which depending on the lock may or may not work. However, this would require the attacker to have access to not only your mobile phone but also a recording, which is highly unlikely.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Two-factor Authentication</h4>
Two-factor Authentication has appeared fairly recently and is an extremely strong option for securing your devices. Two factor takes its name from the fact that it is usually a second line of defence behind passwords. It usually works using an Authenticator App, phone number or another option that only the owner should have access to. It is very important to try and enable this feature on your smart devices as they usually won't have it automatically set up, you must do it yourself. Two factor can also be used to recover stolen accounts, as only you should have access to the authentication. 
<br>
<br>
<h4> Hacking </h4>
Hacking A big issue with Smart Locks is the vulnerabilities to Hacking, now obviously a standard traditional Lock cannot be hacked, this is the risk you run by switching to a digital version. Hackers are constantly a problem and there will always be new vulnerabilities found in Smart Devices, It's very important to take as many precautions as possible to make sure it's not your devices that are being hacked into.
