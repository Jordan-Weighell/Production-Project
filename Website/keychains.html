<h1> Smart Keychains </h1>
<br>    
<p> Smart Keychains are one of the smart devices designed to be very secure, not to say the others aren't however the purpose of a smart keychain is to keep other possessions safe. These devices act like a normal keychain with added features. Such as a lock, and the ability to connect to your other smart devices, you can also add things like passwords to your keychain to make it even more secure.

<h2> Physical Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<h4> Physical </h4>
<p1> When it comes to a smart keychain physically they are quite vulnerable. They are very good at keeping your possessions on them safe, however the device itself isn't the most secure, as a small device made to contain other important possessions you need to keep it in sight at all times. Even though the possessions may stay safe, it is a device that can be easily stolen and if a thief really wanted to they could break through. A lot of Smart keychains come with locks to protect the possessions, and they also have tracking. This is a major upgrade from your traditional keychain, as you can use your mobile phone or app to keep track of where your keychain is at all times. And in the event of it being stolen, you can find out where it is.

<h2> Technical Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<p2>
<h4> Hacking </h4>
Hacking can happen to any smart device due to their nature. Smart Keychains may not be the largest target for this, however it is definitely possible. We recommend you keep your device and app up to date with the latest features to try and avoid trouble. This guide will not go over every attack that could occur, however there are many external tests that have been conducted and published on these devices. If you would like to read more, visit the "published tests" section below.  
<br>
<br>
<h4> Wi-Fi </h4>
When it comes to Smart Devices, Wi-Fi is one of the most important aspects. It is also one that needs to have a close eye kept on. The security of Wi-Fi is universal for all smart devices. It is the thing that connects these devices and enables them to work. With that comes some security risks to keep track off. Due to smart devices relying on your Wi-Fi, you must make sure the Wi-Fi itself is secure. If you are connecting to your home network, making sure your Wi-Fi is private and secure will help prevent most small problems. You should also be careful who you give access to your Wi-Fi network, Once access is gained your devices are at risk, therefore ask questions before handing out your internet passwords to just anyone.
