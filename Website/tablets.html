<h1> Tablets </h1>
<br>    
<p> Tablets have become quite popular in recent times due to their flexibility, they are a combination of your Smartphone and a Laptop. To put it simply, it is like having a larger mobile phone. They use the same operating systems and are usually manufactured by the same companies creating phones. Due to this, a lot of the security and advice to keeping secure is similar to smartphones.
</p>
<br>
<h2> Physical Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<h4> Physical </h4>
<p1> Physically, tablets are larger than your mobile phone, but still one of the smaller smart device's you may have in your home. The same rules apply, keep an eye on your device, don't misplace it and keep it safe. Like many smart devices, tablets can be a target for theft.

<h2> Technical Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<h4> Passwords </h4>
<p2> One of the first things you will do when settings up a Tablet is choosing your Password/Pin. Most newer Tablets now use fingerprints or facial recognition for this instead, which is much more secure, however it is still important to make sure that whatever Password or Pin you choose is secure as it is a solid second line of defence against anyone trying to access your device.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Updates </h4>
Keeping your Tablet updated is important to keep your device secure, updates will include the latest security and fixes for not only your device but your apps. Making sure you are up-to-date is one of the most important steps to keeping your smart device safe.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Wi-Fi </h4>
When it comes to Smart Devices, Wi-Fi is one of the most important aspects. It is also one that needs to have a close eye kept on. The security of Wi-Fi is universal for all smart devices. It is the thing that connects these devices and enables them to work. With that comes some security risks to keep track off. Due to smart devices relying on your Wi-Fi, you must make sure the Wi-Fi itself is secure. If you are connecting to your home network, making sure your Wi-Fi is private and secure will help prevent most small problems. You should also be careful who you give access to your Wi-Fi network, Once access is gained your devices are at risk, therefore ask questions before handing out your internet passwords to just anyone.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Apps </h4>    
It goes without saying that you should be careful what Apps you are downloading onto your Mobile Device. The majority of Apps are most likely safe and the App stores do monitor what is on their available, however due to the sheer volume of apps it's not always possible to notice malicious apps on first sight. Whenever downloading an App on your Tablet, make sure that... One: it is a trusted manufacturer and within the App store. Two: That it isn't a decoy, some apps may take the appearance of another to trick the user into downloading. Make sure you double-check the Apps you are downloading to avoid this.  
<br>
<br>
<h4> Hacking </h4>   
 We are all aware of Hackers, and Tablets are a major target. Due to their high value and the amount of information they store. There are a lot of different attacks hackers may try to pull. Too many to outline here, but most advice boils down to the simple stuff. Don't click any links that look suspicious, be careful who you give your information to, don't share any log in details etc. This guide will not go over every attack that could occur, however there are many external tests that have been conducted and published on these devices. If you would like to read more, visit the "published tests" section below.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Browsers </h4>   
 Browsers can vary depending on the device you use, however most are available to download on any. Some people prefer to use alternative Browsers that they are comfortable with. This is fine as long as you trust them and they are reputable. The main risk with Browsers is the information they store. Browsers themselves, similar to the device, will store a lot of your personal information for later use. As an example, Google Chrome may store your passwords within the browser for ease of use. This is a very nifty feature, however not always safe. The general rule of thumb is to be careful what you give your browser permission to see or use, as well as pick a browser that is well known or that you know is secure.
