<h1> Phones </h1>
<br>    
<p> Smartphone technology has become an essential part of most people's lives, as this technology advances and more data is being stores on these devices, it opens up them up to vulnerabilities. The modern day Smartphone contains a person's Name, Address, Number, Bank details etc. This is great for convenience’s sake, but it also means that these devices are a target for theft. We will outline this security problem as well as offer solutions below.
</p>
<br>
<h2> Physical Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<h4> Physical </h4>
<p1> The Physical Security of smartphones is something that is very much a given, but also very important. Most people have been through the situation of losing their phone or forgetting where it is, however, the problem arises when someone else can get their hands on your phone. Most phones have a good layer of security, however if stolen it could easily be broken into and your data could be stolen.
<br>
<br>
The solution to this problem is simple, try to keep your smartphone on your person or within reaching distance at all times. Another thing you can do to protect your smartphone is having a way to: Track, Lock or Wipe your phone remotely. In a situation where the phone has been stolen or gone missing, it is vital to have these at your disposal.

<h2> Technical Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<h4> Passwords </h4>
<p2> One of the first things you will do when settings up a SmartPhone is choosing your Password/Pin. Newer SmartPhones now use fingerprints or facial recognition for this instead, which is much more secure, however it is still important to make sure that whatever Password or Pin you choose is secure as it is a solid second line of defence against anyone trying to access your device.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Wi-Fi </h4>
When it comes to Smart Devices, Wi-Fi is one of the most important aspects. It is also one that needs to have a close eye kept on. The security of Wi-Fi is universal for all smart devices. It is the thing that connects these devices and enables them to work. With that comes some security risks to keep track off. Due to smart devices relying on your Wi-Fi, you must make sure the Wi-Fi itself is secure. If you are connecting to your home network, making sure your Wi-Fi is private and secure will help prevent most small problems. You should also be careful who you give access to your Wi-Fi network, Once access is gained your devices are at risk, therefore ask questions before handing out your internet passwords to just anyone.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Updates </h4>
Modern Smartphones are the equivalent of having a small computer in your pocket. And just like computers, they need to be kept up to date with not only new features but also protection. There are always going to be new ways for devices such as phones to be hacked into or threatened in some way. Making sure your mobile is updates is extremely important, as these updates contain protection for your device against the newest threats. No matter what Smartphone you have this is universal whether Apple, Android, Google etc, these devices need the constant maintenance. Due to updates being mostly optional, many forget to manually set them off. To keep your device secure, keep an eye on when it needs updating and make sure to do it when most convenient.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Apps </h4>    
It goes without saying that you should be careful what Apps you are downloading onto your Mobile Device. The majority of Apps are most likely safe and the App stores do monitor what is on their available, however due to the sheer volume of apps it's not always possible to notice malicious apps on first sight. Whenever downloading an App on your Smartphone, make sure that... One: it is a trusted manufacturer and within the App store. Two: That it isn't a decoy, some apps may take the appearance of another to trick the user into downloading. Make sure you double-check the Apps you are downloading to avoid this.  
<br>
<br>
<h4> Browsers </h4>   
 Browsers can vary depending on the device you use, however most are available to download on any. Some people prefer to use alternative Browsers that they are comfortable with. This is fine as long as you trust them and they are reputable. The main risk with Browsers is the information they store. Browsers themselves, similar to the device, will store a lot of your personal information for later use. As an example, Google Chrome may store your passwords within the browser for ease of use. This is a very nifty feature, however not always safe. The general rule of thumb is to be careful what you give your browser permission to see or use, as well as pick a browser that is well known or that you know is secure.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Hacking </h4>   
 We are all aware of Hackers, and Smartphones are a major target. Due to their high value and the amount of information they store. There are a lot of different attacks hackers may try to pull. Too many to outline here, but most advice boils down to the simple stuff. Don't click any links that look suspicious, be careful who you give your information to, don't share any log in details etc. This guide will not go over every attack that could occur, however there are many external tests that have been conducted and published on these devices. If you would like to read more, visit the "published tests" section below.
