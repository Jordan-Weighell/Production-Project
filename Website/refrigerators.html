<h1> Refrigerators </h1>
<br>    
<p> Smart Refrigerators have become quite a sought after possession in recent years. They aren't all that different from your standard refrigerator other than the fact you can control your home and connect to other devices through it while keeping the basic functions the same. Smart Refrigerators may seem like one of the safer smart devices in your home, it's in one place, can't be stolen etc. However, there are still some risks involved in owning one.
</p>
<br>
<h2> Physical Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<h4> Physical </h4>
<p1> There isn't too much to talk about when it comes to the physical security of a Smart Refrigerator. Compared to the majority of smart devices, this one is usually a large object and installed within a household. There is slim to none chances of theft in that aspect. However, one issue could occur that an intruder may be able to gain access to the rest of your Smart home using this device. Due to this, even a Smart Refrigerator needs a password to protect it.

<br>    
<h2> Technical Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<p2>
<h4> Wi-Fi </h4>
When it comes to Smart Devices, Wi-Fi is one of the most important aspects. It is also one that needs to have a close eye kept on. The security of Wi-Fi is universal for all smart devices. It is the thing that connects these devices and enables them to work. With that comes some security risks to keep track off. Due to smart devices relying on your Wi-Fi, you must make sure the Wi-Fi itself is secure. If you are connecting to your home network, making sure your Wi-Fi is private and secure will help prevent most small problems. You should also be careful who you give access to your Wi-Fi network, Once access is gained your devices are at risk, therefore ask questions before handing out your internet passwords to just anyone.    
<br>
<br>
<h4> Hacking </h4>
Hacking is still a persistent threat, no matter what smart device you are using. Even a smart Refrigerator can be hacked. The same precautions can be taken to stop this, such as keeping the device up to date with the latest security, as well as keeping your Wi-Fi secure. This guide will not go over every attack that could occur, however there are many external tests that have been conducted and published on these devices. If you would like to read more, visit the "published tests" section below.
