<h1> Speakers </h1>
<br>    
<p> Smart Speakers are becoming increasingly popular among many households, even those who aren't as interested in having a smart home may still own one of these devices. They work in the same way as other mobile smart devices in that you plug it in and connect to your home. They are mostly designed around playing music, however there are many other uses, such as their voice recognition features. Furthermore, they can be used to google, play music, read you a book etc. There are a lot of different speakers on the market, however they mostly do the same things. Like any smart device, though, there are some security risks involved.
</p>
<br>
<h2> Physical Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<h4> Physical </h4>
<p1> A Smart Speaker, like other small smart devices, are prone to damage. They may not be as small as your mobile phone or a smartwatch, however they are quite delicate and should be looked after. A difference here is that Smart Speakers usually are placed in the same place within a home. The majority require to be plugged in, and their voice features can hear far, meaning there isn't a requirement to move them. As the same with all smaller Smart devices put it somewhere secure, these devices are a prime target for theft, therefore keeping it out of reach and or sight may be a good precaution.

<h2> Technical Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<p2>
<h4> Passwords </h4>
Most Smart Speaker work a bit differently than other smart devices. While the majority use screens and active motion from the user, a lot of smart speakers don't, they use your voice. This can be seen as an upside and a downside. On one hand, they are fairly secure using voice recognition, however there isn't as much in the way of settings and things you can configure. Most of the configurations are done using an app for the speaker, so make sure you look through these and configure your settings appropriately.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Voice Recognition </h4>
Voice Recognition is a major function of a Smart Speaker. This feature is fairly secure, however could potentially be manipulated. Depending on the speaker it may be configured to only response to certain voices, this is pretty secure and has much fewer issues however, there are many speakers which don't do this, or people don't configure to. Now this may sound fine, however there are scenarios where this is a major security risk, imagine for a second your smart home is hooked up with a Smart Lock and Speaker. There is potential for an intruder to access your speaker through voice controls and unlock your door. Now this is a far-fetched idea, however it shows the dangers this could include. A speaker like your mobile phone is a gateway into the rest of your smart home, and it is important that it's kept secure.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Wi-Fi </h4>
When it comes to Smart Devices, Wi-Fi is one of the most important aspects. It is also one that needs to have a close eye kept on. The security of Wi-Fi is universal for all smart devices. It is the thing that connects these devices and enables them to work. With that comes some security risks to keep track off. Due to smart devices relying on your Wi-Fi, you must make sure the Wi-Fi itself is secure. If you are connecting to your home network, making sure your Wi-Fi is private and secure will help prevent most small problems. You should also be careful who you give access to your Wi-Fi network, Once access is gained your devices are at risk, therefore ask questions before handing out your internet passwords to just anyone.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Updates </h4>
Updates are a key part of keeping your Smart home secure, and speakers are no different. They may not need constant hardware upgrades like a phone, but they and their apps do need to be kept up to date in order to maintain security. There are always new threats surfacing every day for smart devices, and keeping updated with the developers software is important to stop this.
