<h1> Smartwatches </h1>
<br>    
<p> Smartwatches are a newer digital version of your traditional wristwatch. They have similar characteristics to Mobile Phones. In that they can access the internet, apps, smartwatches can even be used in place of a mobile phone to operate your other smart devices. Due to this, Smartwatches have become very popular, containing all the features of a traditional watch mixed with a smartphone. However, with this comes some security risks both technical and physical which will be outlined below.
</p>
<br>
<h2> Physical Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<h4> Physical</h4>
<p1> Watches similar to other handheld Smart Devices are quite vulnerable physically. The ability to lose them or misplace is a risk involved in owning these devices, however unlike your traditional wristwatch losing a smartwatch could be a much bigger issue. Due to the amount of information stores on these devices, you are not only losing a watch, you are losing your data too. The same principles of a mobile phone also apply to the smartwatch. Keep it on or near you at all times, especially in public. As it is a smaller item it can be easy to misplace, but as long as you stay attentive, keeping your smartwatch physically safe shouldn't be an issue.

<h2> Technical Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<p2>
<h4> Data </h4>
Smartwatches hold a lot of information. Due to their nature, they are almost comparable to mobile phones in the amount of personal information stored. This is highly convenient to have all of this on your wrist, however it opens you up to security risks you wouldn't get with a traditional watch. The same general rules apply for data on all smart devices. Be careful who you share your information with. What apps you may allow access, which browsers etc. Keeping your data secure should be a number one priority.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Wi-Fi </h4>
When it comes to Smart Devices, Wi-Fi is one of the most important aspects. It is also one that needs to have a close eye kept on. The security of Wi-Fi is universal for all smart devices. It is the thing that connects these devices and enables them to work. With that comes some security risks to keep track off. Due to smart devices relying on your Wi-Fi, you must make sure the Wi-Fi itself is secure. If you are connecting to your home network, making sure your Wi-Fi is private and secure will help prevent most small problems. You should also be careful who you give access to your Wi-Fi network, Once access is gained your devices are at risk, therefore ask questions before handing out your internet passwords to just anyone. 
<br>
<br>
<h4> Settings </h4>
Smartwatches have their own settings however, they appropriate security settings may not be set up straight away. Like many Smart Devices, the settings need to be configured and set up to protect your device. Enabling things like two-factor authentication can add a much stronger layer of defence for your device. When you get a new Smartwatch, make sure to check through your settings and make sure it is set up properly and up to date. 
<br>
<br>
<h4> Tracking </h4>
The majority of Smartwatches have tracking features. This can be used to track you as a person or the watch if it gets lost. This is a feature that has upsides and downsides concerning security. On the upside, if your device is lost but has tracking enabled, it can be easy to find. However, some people may not feel secure having their movements tracked by their device. There are usually settings on your device to turn this on or off depending on your stance.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Hacking </h4>
Smartwatches are vulnerable to Hacking. Smartwatches use similar technology to other smart devices that are going to be vulnerable to hacking. This is one of the downsides of switching to Smart technology. To prevent this, try to keep your information private, passwords secure and always keep your device up to date with the latest security. This guide will not go over every attack that could occur, however there are many external tests that have been conducted and published on these devices.
