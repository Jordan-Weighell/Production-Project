<h1> Doorbells </h1>
<br>    
<p> Smart Doorbells are an alternative to your standard traditional doorbell. They have features such as camera's, microphone's, and the ability to check your door no matter your location. Everyone has missed a delivery or a visitor when out, however with a Smart Doorbell you can see who is at your door through an app. This is highly convenient, and these devices are becoming extremely popular due to this. However, there are some privacy and security risks in owning one.
</p>
<br>
<h2> Physical Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<p1> Unlike most other smart devices, the Smart Doorbell is located on the outside of your home. This unfortunately makes them a target for theft. Thankfully the majority of these devices include camera microphones and tracking information which is all relayed to your mobile app meaning any incident that occurs can be recorded and followed. This is a huge deterrence for thieves, however it doesn't mean you are completely safe. There isn't much you can do other than install your smart doorbell securely and make sure you have enabled all the security mentioned above.

<h2> Technical Security Risks</h2>
<br>
<p2>
<h4> Hacking </h4> 
Hacking of doorbells can occur, although rare. Make sure you keep your device secure with passwords and keep your App safe. This guide will not go over every attack that could occur, however there are many external tests that have been conducted and published on these devices. If you would like to read more, visit the "published tests" section below.      
<br>
<br>
<h4> Wi-Fi </h4> 
When it comes to Smart Devices, Wi-Fi is one of the most important aspects. It is also one that needs to have a close eye kept on. The security of Wi-Fi is universal for all smart devices. It is the thing that connects these devices and enables them to work. With that comes some security risks to keep track off. Due to smart devices relying on your Wi-Fi, you must make sure the Wi-Fi itself is secure. If you are connecting to your home network, making sure your Wi-Fi is private and secure will help prevent most small problems. You should also be careful who you give access to your Wi-Fi network, Once access is gained your devices are at risk, therefore ask questions before handing out your internet passwords to just anyone.
